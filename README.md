hi rays of hope

am called by the synonym of wave, Lahari.
today is the day i started looking into the space of dark and unknown universe around me.
then comes the one always revolves around my any thought, giving me the hope to use universe and learn about dark space, expand your wings 
as a austronaut to lit the ray of hope in rocket science sitting in ma mind.

this is my brief thought of github.
